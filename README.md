Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Cocooncenter Pharmacy Dataset

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project, a process of analyzing and visualizing data sets to summarize their main characteristics. The focus is on a dataset related to body care products obtained from Cocooncenter Pharmacy. The primary goal of EDA is to understand underlying patterns, relationships, and trends in the data.

Key Files:

Cocooncenter_pharmacy.csv: The dataset file containing information about body care products.
EDA_Cocooncenter_pharmacy.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file with the code and visualizations for the EDA.

Feel free to explore the project, analyze the visualizations, and gain insights into the characteristics of the body care product dataset.
